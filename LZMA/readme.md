> Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) by Igor Pavlov is an algorithm used to perform lossless data compression. 
>
> LZMA is used in the 7z format of the 7-Zip archiver. This algorithm uses a dictionary compression scheme somewhat similar to the LZ77 algorithm published by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977 and features a high compression ratio (generally higher than bzip2) and a variable compression-dictionary size (up to 4 GB), while still maintaining decompression speed similar to other commonly used compression algorithms.
